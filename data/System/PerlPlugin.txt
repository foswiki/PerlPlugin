%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

This plugin allows you to embed scripts within topics, using a tightly
controlled subset of Perl. The scripts will be executed on the server,
and the result displayed in the topic.

Scripts are executed inside a
[[http://perldoc.perl.org/Safe.html][Safe container]] that *strictly* limits
what the perl script can do. By default only basic operations are permitted,
as well as access to a subset of the =Foswiki::Func= interface. No IO
operations, such as print or file manipulation are permitted, and neither
is sub-process execution.

The range of permitted operations can easily be customised from the
=configure= interface.

---++ Usage
   * =%<nop>PERL{"perl expression"}%=
Expands to the result of the perl expression, evaluated in a Safe container.

The constraints imposed by the container are defined in the Foswiki
configuration.

Because the perl expression is entered as a parameter to a Foswiki macro, the
usual constraints on characters apply. Note especially that double-quotes have to be escaped using \" e.g =%<nop>PERL{"my $meal=\"fish";\"I ate a $meal\""}%=

---++ Examples
If the plugin is installed, the text after 'expands to' will show the result of the example.
   * =%<nop>PERL{"'A String'"}%= expands to %PERL{"'A String'"}%
   * =%<nop>PERL{"101 - 59"}%= expands to %PERL{"101 - 59"}%

Note that the same container is used for each %<nop>PERL call made during rendering. As a result, a perl function defined in one %<nop>PERL will be available in other %<nop>PERLs that are evaluated later.
   * =%<nop>PERL{"sub x{95};x()"}%...%<nop>PERL{"x()+164"}%= expands to %PERL{"sub x{95};x()"}%...%PERL{"x()+164"}%

---++ WARNING
The default configuration is designed for the following
requirements:
   * Basic Perl,
   * Can use loops, define and call functions, 
   * Can call Foswiki::Func functions (except readFile and saveFile),
*This provides the user with enough rope to hang your server!*

For example, an infinite loop may (in some server configurations) 
result in a denial of service to other users. You are recommended to
think carefully about the abilities of your users before enabling
this configuration. <span class="foswikiAlert">You have been warned!</span>

Another common configuration that provides a lot less rope to the end user
(and thus protects your server better) is as follows:
<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{PerlPlugin}{Opcodes} = {
    Permit => [], # :default only
    Deny => [ ':base_mem', ':base_loop', ':base_orig' ] };
$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{PerlPlugin}{Share} = {}; # no access to Foswiki::Func
</verbatim>
This denies access to looping constructs.

If you want to use an even smaller subset of Perl then you should
read the [[http://perldoc.perl.org/Safe.html][Safe]] and [[http://perldoc.perl.org/Opcode.html][Opcode]] manual pages.
